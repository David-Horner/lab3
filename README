Quick and dirty instructions:

CHECKOUT THE CODE:

  git submodule update --init --recursive


BUILDING THE TOOLCHAIN:

  To build RISC-V ISA simulator, frontend server, proxy kernel and newlib based GNU toolchain:

    export RISCV=/path/to/riscv/toolchain/installation
    cd riscv-tools
    ./build.sh

  To build asm tests and benchmarks (you must have the RISC-V toolchain installed and in your path):

    cd riscv-tests/isa/
    make -j

    cd riscv-tests/benchmarks
    make -j

BUILDING THE PROJECT:

  To build the C simulator:

    cd emulator
    make

  To build the VCS simulator:

    cd vlsi/build/vcs-sim-rtl
    make

  in either case, you can run a set of assembly tests or simple benchmarks:

    make run-asm-tests
    make run-vecasm-tests
    make run-vecasm-timer-tests
    make run-bmarks-test

  To build a C simulator that is capable of VCD waveform generation:

    cd emulator
    make emulator-debug

  And to run the assembly tests on the C simulator and generate waveforms:

    make run-asm-tests-debug
    make run-vecasm-tests-debug
    make run-vecasm-timer-tests-debug
    make run-bmarks-test-debug


UPDATING TO A NEWER VERSION OF CHISEL:

  To grab a newer version of chisel:

    git submodule update --init
    cd chisel
    git pull origin master

  Then, to compile it and install it into the rocket repo:

    cd sbt
    sbt package
    cp chisel/target/scala-2.8.1/chisel_2.8.1-1.1.jar ../../sbt/work/lib

  If you commit a new jar, you must also commit the updated chisel submodule.
